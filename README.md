# Assassin

### Rules

- How to assassinate: Touch the person you are “assassinating” on the back of a head with a CLEAN sock on your hand.
- YOUR TARGET MUST NOT SEE YOU WHEN YOU ASSASSINATE. IF THEY SEE YOU AND SAY THAT THEY SEE YOU, YOU CANNOT GET THEM UNTIL 1 HOUR LATER.
- You can only assassinate your target.
- Please be honest when you get killed.
- Do not interrupt a class or test of any sort to assassinate. If you need to do that you just aren’t good enough to play the game.
- Especially when we are taking finals DO NOT DISRUPT.
- IF YOU ARE CAUGHT CHEATING a bounty will be put out on your head, and every player will be instructed to assassinate you as well as their target.
